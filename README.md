## Dataset
The solar dataset comprises 366 records and includes 23 essential columns: 'Date', 'ICR-3 - INV1', 'ICR-3 - INV2', 'ICR-3 - INV3', 'ICR-3 - INV4', 'ICR-4 - INV1', 'ICR-4 - INV2', 'ICR-4 - INV3', 'ICR-4 - INV4', 'Total Daily Integrated Generation MWh', 'PSS Main Meter (Cumulative Plant end meter reading)(Export)MWH', 'PSS Main Meter (Cumulative Plant end meter reading)(Import)MWh', 'PSS Check Meter (Cumulative Plant end meter reading)(Export)MWh', 'PSS Check Meter (Cumulative Plant end meter reading)(Import)MWh', 'PSS Main Meter (Daily Generation Plant end meter )(Export)MWh', 'PSS Main Meter (Daily Generation Plant end meter )(Import)MWh', 'Daily Generation Plant end meter (net)MWh', 'Global Tilted Irradiation/Irradiance (GTI)kWh/m2', 'Global horizontal irradiance (GHI)kMh/m2', 'Performance Ratio (PR) %', 'Grid Downtime HH:MM', 'Plant Downtime HH:MM', 'Remarks'.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Dropped columns 'Grid Downtime HH' and 'Plant Downtime HH' due to lack of variability.
2. Handled missing values using mean imputation for numerical columns and median imputation for categorical columns.
3. Treated outliers using the Winsorizer IQR method.
4. No zero-variance columns were found.

## Key Insights
1. **Average Performance**: The inverter performance is rated at 79.00 on average.
2. **Net Daily Energy Generation**: The average net daily energy generation from the solar power system is 156.86 kWh.
3. **Total Daily Integrated Generation**: The average total daily integrated generation is 122.16 kWh.
4. **Daily Net Generation by Remarks**: The highest generation is observed when the weather is sunny, while factors like clouds, high winds, and snow cover lead to lower generation.
5. **Yearly Trends**: There is an increasing trend in daily net generation and total daily integrated generation over time, indicating improved solar power generation.
6. **Monitoring**: The solar power system is equipped with monitoring capabilities like inverter performance tracking, meter reading, and irradiance vs. generation measurement, which aid in optimizing the system's performance.

## Challenges and Limitations
1. **Weather Dependence**: Solar power generation is highly dependent on weather conditions, making it challenging to predict and rely on as a consistent energy source.
2. **Inverter Performance**: Regular maintenance and performance tracking are required to ensure inverters operate optimally, which can be resource-intensive.
3. **Data Accuracy and Monitoring**: Ensuring the accuracy of meter readings and irradiance measurements is critical, and implementing and maintaining advanced monitoring systems can be costly.
4. **Seasonal Variations**: Production fluctuations due to seasonal variations may necessitate additional storage or alternative energy sources during certain periods.

## Future Scopes
1. **Improved Weather Forecasting and Adaptation**: Developing better predictive models for weather patterns and implementing adaptive systems can help optimize energy capture.
2. **Enhanced Storage Solutions**: Integrating advanced battery storage systems and better grid integration can mitigate challenges posed by weather variability and ensure a steady supply of power.
